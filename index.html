              <h3>Japanese painter and woodblock printmaker</h3>
              <p>Yoshida Hiroshi (吉田 博) was a painter and woodblock printmaker born in the late 1870s in Fukuoka Prefecture in Japan. He is notable as an artist of the <i>shin-hanga</i> style, which was an art movement that arose during the 20th century in Japan that was said to have revitalized the traditional <i>ukiyo-e</i> art rooted in the 17th-19th century Edo and Meiji periods, and was known for incorporating Western elements such as the effects of light and the expression of moods, while still focusing on the traditional themes of landscapes, famous places, beautiful women, kabuki actors and birds-and-flowers.</p>
              <p>Having traveled widely to different places all over the world, Hiroshi was particularly known for his landscape prints and images of non-Japanese subjects depicted in traditional Japanese woodblock style prints, such as the Swiss Alps, Grand Canyon, and Taj Mahal among others. He was also known to have used the same wood  blocks in his works, but with varied colors to depict various moods. A well known example is the series of <i>Sailing Boats</i> done in 1921, a couple of which are shown below.</p>
